/**
* The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol
* between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
* The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
* repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
* network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

*******************************
*
* DESCRIPTION
* The ArduinoGateway prints data received from sensors on the serial link.
* The gateway accepts input on serial which will be sent out on radio network.
*
* The GW code is designed for Arduino Nano 328p / 16MHz
*
* Wire connections (OPTIONAL):
* - Inclusion button should be connected between digital pin 3 and GND
* - RX/TX/ERR leds need to be connected between +5V (anode) and digital pin 6/5/4 with resistor 270-330R in a series
*
* LEDs (OPTIONAL):
* - To use the feature, uncomment any of the MY_DEFAULT_xx_LED_PINs
* - RX (green) - blink fast on radio message received. In inclusion mode will blink fast only on presentation received
* - TX (yellow) - blink fast on radio message transmitted. In inclusion mode will blink slowly
* - ERR (red) - fast blink on error during transmission error or receive crc error
*
* OTA DEBUG MESSAGES
* - Add the OTADebugReceive(message) into receive(const MyMessage &message) on a serial connected node
* - Add '#define MY_DEBUG_OTA (0)' to your Node sketch by replacing (0) with the node id of your serial connected node
